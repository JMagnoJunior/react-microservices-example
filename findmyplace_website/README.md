# Find My Place - React Website

I do not consider myself as a really good front end programmer, but still I know something about ReactJs, Javascript and Functional Programming.

This project shows how to interacts with my back end services. It uses redux and immutables and it is totally based on a functional programming.

I am trying to keep the directory structure very simple, but it will change when this application grow.

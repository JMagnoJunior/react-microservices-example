# react-microservices-example

In this project I will try to show some concepts and techonologies related to microservices. For this I will build a booking app and I will try to descibre with some details each step taken. Furthermore, I will build a react app to consume these microservies. 

This project will run inside a docker. The docker-compose file will be useful to run this project.
